-----------------------------------
What`s new:
  Light version:
   - improved look in iPhone (yes, again!)
  Full version:
   - changed way operations are executed in command line: Dolphin.php does not "hang" if you entered invalid command:
     now, you can just close terminal, open it again and kill the application you launched
   - added Multipart for the following operations: copy, delete, chmod, directory size count and for properties window:
     These operations will show their state every 5 seconds (this could be changed in config.php -- new directives MAX_MULTIPART_TIME and USE_MULTIPART added). You should not close browser window, when operation is run -- it will stop otherwise.
  
    Multipart does not support FTP, though: you may use light version if Multipart does not work correctly.
